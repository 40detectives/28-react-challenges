Build a React application that shows the national holidays for the current year, for a given country.

Outline of the main tasks:

- Research API documentation
- A dropdown with a list of countries
- A list of public holidays for the selected country

You can retrieve a list of available countries and their holidays from the [OpenHolidays API](https://www.openholidaysapi.org/en/api/?ref=reactpractice.dev). Use **English** (`en`) for the `languageIsoCode`.
By default, you should show the holidays for **The Netherlands**.
